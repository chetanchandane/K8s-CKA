# How `kubectl apply` Works Behind the Scenes

`kubectl apply` is a command used to manage applications on a Kubernetes cluster. It allows you to create and update resources declaratively. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. **Read the Configuration File**:
   - `kubectl apply` reads the configuration file (YAML or JSON) that describes the desired state of the Kubernetes resources.

2. **Convert to JSON**:
   - The configuration file is converted to JSON format for processing.

3. **Retrieve Current State**:
   - `kubectl` communicates with the Kubernetes API server to retrieve the current state of the resources defined in the configuration file.

4. **Calculate Differences**:
   - It compares the desired state (from the configuration file) with the current state (from the API server).
   - It calculates the differences between the two states.

5. **Generate Patch**:
   - Based on the differences, `kubectl` generates a patch that describes the changes needed to transition from the current state to the desired state.

6. **Apply Patch**:
   - The patch is sent to the Kubernetes API server.
   - The API server processes the patch and updates the resources accordingly.

7. **Update Resource Version**:
   - The resource version is updated to reflect the changes.
   - This ensures that subsequent operations are based on the latest state.

8. **Handle Conflicts**:
   - If there are conflicts (e.g., concurrent updates), `kubectl` may retry the operation or prompt the user to resolve the conflict.

9. **Feedback to User**:
   - `kubectl` provides feedback to the user, indicating whether the operation was successful or if there were any errors.

By using `kubectl apply`, you can manage your Kubernetes resources declaratively, ensuring that the cluster's state matches the desired configuration specified in your files.


### Why Do We Need the `last-applied-configuration`?

The `last-applied-configuration` annotation is crucial for the `kubectl apply` command to function correctly. Here's why:

1. **Track Changes**:
    - It stores the last configuration that was applied to the resource. This allows `kubectl` to track changes made to the resource over time.

2. **Calculate Diffs**:
    - By comparing the current configuration with the `last-applied-configuration`, `kubectl` can determine what changes need to be applied to reach the desired state.

3. **Avoid Overwriting**:
    - It helps prevent overwriting changes made by other users or processes. `kubectl` can identify and merge changes rather than replacing the entire resource configuration.

4. **Conflict Resolution**:
    - In case of conflicts, having the `last-applied-configuration` helps in resolving them by providing a reference to the last known good state.

5. **Declarative Management**:
    - It supports the declarative management approach of Kubernetes, ensuring that the cluster's state is continuously aligned with the desired configuration.

Without the `last-applied-configuration`, `kubectl apply` would not be able to perform these critical functions effectively, leading to potential inconsistencies and conflicts in the cluster state.
